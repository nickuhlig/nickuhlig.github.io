# Made in Canada

I have compiled a list of clothing labels and companies that manufacture their products (at least some of them) in Canada. 

The list was posted on reddit twice ([1](https://www.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/4bkiwa/madeincanada_clothing_a_list/), [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/58n18s/made_in_canada_clothing_a_list_v_20/)), and received a lot of feedback, as well as suggestions for brands to be added/included in the list.

Recently, the process of translating it into Français has begun, though it has not yet been completed.

To download the list you have two options.

The first is for a printable version. All sections start on right-hand pages. You can find this one [here](https://drive.google.com/uc?download=view&id=0Bz5r07H3CVJAeF9icE9wN3hBeTA).

The second is for a version to be kept on your computer. Sections start on any new page, reducing the overall page count. You can find this one [here](https://drive.google.com/uc?download=view&id=0Bz5r07H3CVJAdThnREJ2bXhaMHM).

Both are living documents and will be updated semi-regularly by me, when I have time. Usually I wait until I have a stck of 20 or 30 changes to make. All updates are captured in the documents' changelogs.

### Future versions

In the future I plan to convert this to a searchable blog, something like a tumblr, using tags to allow sorting.

This won't happen until I have time, but when it does, I will probably post about it to reddit again.
