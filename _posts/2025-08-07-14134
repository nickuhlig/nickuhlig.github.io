I wrote a blog entry for Housing Medford recently about infrastructure impacts and how they are accounted for by things like development fees/impact fees/linkage fees. 

The way these cost structures look varies from municipality to municipality. For instance, for any new single family home in Toronto, a developer can expect to pay >$100k in fees.

In other jurisdictions like my current home of Medford, Massachusetts, however, these fees are only levied for certain types of development and are typically much lower.
