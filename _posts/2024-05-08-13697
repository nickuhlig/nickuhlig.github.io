rainbow runway lights<br>
like night-time phosphorescence<br>
vanish far below<br>

--or

fruiting bodies thrust<br>
above white mycelium:<br>
towers in the fog

--or

each cloud has a taste<br>
they drift past in their thousands<br>
like frozen honeyed milk

--or

the clouds are mountains<br>
above the sweetwater sea<br>
my eyes close softly

--and

each journey brings pain.<br>
each flight is a little death,<br>
drowning in sunsets
