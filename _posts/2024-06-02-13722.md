drown my heart off the long-frozen shore<br>
of the freshwater legend that swallows all pride.<br>
a thousand years hence you will still see it clearly<br>
in water so big that it has its own tides.

bury my heart in the pine-needled hush<br>
in that sun-dappled shade where the wendigo sleeps.<br>
in soft silent halls it may sprout once again,<br>
and render its fruit, wet with blood, good to eat.

hang up my heart on the whisky-jack's perch<br>
while white robed sentinels hold congress above<br>
the winds of their speech will freeze it like suet--<br>
to be thawed by the sun's unconditional love.
