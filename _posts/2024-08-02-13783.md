i am that dime-at-arm's-length moonblink,<br>
that tapetum flash of a rabbit bounding into cattails<br>
at the sound of your laboured breath.

i am the halt in the rhythmic dealer's shuffle<br>
of the cricket in the evening's final sigh.

i am that tiny fall like an elevator's jolt<br>
as you wake: no map, no name, and no mouth.

i am a quickened step, a sharply drawn breath,<br>
a tug on the filament of your much-entangled heart.

pay me the salary of your tears,<br>
and i may take my leave,<br>
but heed me, for i know my craft and custom.

though your terrain may warp and stretch,<br>
the signalfire is lighted still,<br>
incandescing in that eyeless dark to guide me home.
