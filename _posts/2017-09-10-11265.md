## The chemistry of William Gibson's *Neuromancer*.

I recently purchased a new hard copy of William Gibson's first novel (and sci-fi classic), *Neuromancer*. I make no secrets about this book being my favourite of all time, and I've even got [an ongoing project](https://soundcloud.com/the-plc/sets/neuromancer-audio) wherein I'm composing a musical companion to the book.

Apart from inventing the term "cyberspace" and predicting virtual reality long before it became commonplace, the book also contains some interesting tidbits of chemistry. Being a chemist myself, these little nuggets of scientific prose jump out at me, and quite pleasantly Gibson (for the most part) does an excellent job of using them appropriately. I wanted to examine the drugs used in the book, which are almost entirely used by Case and Peter Riviera, the two biggest junkies in the book.

### Octagons: "dex"

Dex is a shorthand name for dextroamphetamine. Anyone familiar with methamphetamine will recognize that it is in fact the same molecule--or to be more specific, a single enantiomer of that molecule.

In chemistry, molecules that have the same chemical formula are known as "isomers" of each other. This broad term means that the constituent atoms are the same in number and composition, but that the molecules themselves are different in structure in some way. There are many sub-classes of isomer, one of which is enantiomer. This term refers to molecules which are mirror-images of one another, but which cannot be superimposed. The easiest analogy for this would be your hands. Hold them up so that your palms face you and your pinky fingers touch. Ignoring minor differences, they are clearly mirror images of one another. But now turn over your right hand. Your thumbs point the same way and your hands could overlap, but they clearly are not superimposable: your knuckles bend in different directions, your palms face different ways, and so on. These are enantiomers. Likewise, look at dextroamphetamine and levoamphetamine:

<div style="text-align: center"> ![Dextroamphetamine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dextroamphetamine#/media/File:D-amphetamine.svg) ![Levoamphetamine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levoamphetamine#/media/File:L-amphetamine.svg) </div>

The solid wedged bond in dextroamphetamine means the "CH3" group is projecting towards the viewer, while the hashed bond means it projects away from the viewer. The only difference in structure between these two molecules is the "chirality" (which comes from the Greek word for hand, transliterated roughly as "kheir") of that carbon center. 

Interestingly, the R (or D) enantiomer is the more active of the two in the human body, with effects including increased concentration, CNS stimulation, and in higher doses, euphoria and libido enhancement. Street amphetamine (crystal meth, or simply meth) is almost always a mixture of the two enantiomers of amphetamine, because isolating a single enantiomer usually requires more advanced equipment, more time, and more money. Enantiomerically pure dextroamphetamine is used in drugs for narcolepsy and ADHD (most people are familiar with the drug Adderall, which is a 3:1 mixture of dextroamphetamine and levoamphetamine. There are [other drug products](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dextroamphetamine#Formulations) which use different ratios, the most well-known of which is probably Dexedrine, which is a 100% dextroamphetamine sulfate formulation.

Thus, when Case takes "Brazilian dex", he is quite simply imbibing a powerful CNS stimulant that has been known for decades and used by everyone from clubgoers and beat poets to fighter pilots and college students.

### Case's new pancreas & the plugs in his liver

Early in the book Case undergoes a highly invasive (though mostly unspecified) set of surgeries to allow him to "punch deck" and resume his career as a virtual reality hacker. During this surgery he has a "new pancreas...and plugs in [his] liver" installed, which make him incapable of getting high on cocaine or amphetamines (including his beloved dex). How involved the pancreas is in the metabolism of these drugs is not known to me, but presumably the plugs in his liver would do one (or all) of the following things:

1. Severly amp-up his body's production of monoamine oxidase (MAO) which is the primary mechanism for the metabolism of amphetamines and other psychoactive alkaloids like phenethylamines and tryptamines;
2. Up-regulate expression of cytochrome p450 (CYP450) enzymes in the liver, which are probably the most important class of drug-metabolizing enzymes, through a mechanism called oxidation;
3. Up-regulate his body's production of esterases, which are the main enzymes responsible for the first line of cocaine metabolism and elimination;
4. Some other type of hand-wavy metabolism-altering or endocrine-altering thing.

MAO is a frequent culprit in the lack of oral bioavailability of alkaloid drugs. Dimethyltryptamine (DMT) for instance, has almost no oral bioavailability because MAO-A is abundantly present in the digestive tract and metabolizes it before it can be absorbed into the blood stream and carried to the brain. Ayahuasca, a South American traditional entheogenic drug, involves ingesting DMT along with a MAO inhibitor, which allows the powerful and profound psychedelic experiences used in shamanistic rituals.

CYP450 is another one that you may come across from time to time. It is responsible for doing the lion's share of xenobiotics in the human body. These enzymes are highly concentrated in the liver, and generally deal with drugs in one way: oxidation. What this does is (very generally) to become more water soluble, allowing excretion via the renal system and urinary tract. One reason you may have heard of it is that a certain blockbuster drug named Lipitor has some unusual contraindications. People taking this drug (which is a statin inhibitor) are [told not to ingest large quantities of grapefruit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grapefruit%E2%80%93drug_interactions). The reason for this is that grapefruit and grapefruit juice contain a relatively potent class of CYP450 inhibitor called [furanocoumarins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furanocoumarin), which causes the Lipitor to hang around in the body unmetabolized (and therefore performing its intended function) longer than it should, which can cause problems. CYP450 is also produced in the pancreas, relevant to the current discussion.

Esterases are again a liver-localized family of enzymes that--you guessed it--cleave esters. Cocaine is primarily metabolized by esterases in the liver to produce benzoylecgonine, which is identical to cocaine except for the cleavage of the methyl ester:

<div style="text-align: center"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Benzoylecgonine-2D-skeletal.png" width=128>benzoylecgonine</img><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/66/Kokain_-_Cocaine.svg" width=128>cocaine</img></div>

Again, this modification makes the drug more water soluble, and it is this mechanism that is responsible for cocaine's notoriously short duration of effect: roughly 30 minutes after snorting.

So the "new pancreas and liver" thing is actually reasonably plausible, though of course we get nothing else by way of explanation, so we can chalk this one up to the vagaries of good science fiction writing: just enough to make it seem doable without so much detail that it begins to fall apart.

### Riviera's cocktail: cocaine & meperidine

We've already discussed cocaine, and most are probably familiar with its effects, even if not first hand. [Meperidine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pethidine), however, is probably better known by its trade name Demerol (or possibly its alternate name pethidine). Meperidine is an analgesic synthetic opioid, though it bears no resemblance to naturally-derived opioids like morphine, heroin, hydromorphone (Dilaudid), or codeine, all of which containe the characteristic fused ring structure at their core. Meperidine and other synthetic opioids are so named because they also bind to the opioid receptors in the brain. 

This means that meperidine is, like other opioids, an analgesic sedative and CNS depressant. It is commonly used in labour for pain management (administered primarily via IV, and *not* by epidural).

So as the Finn says, Peter is a speedball artist. He mixes cocaine with an opioid (a fairly mild one, it can be said) to get his desired high, much like some people mix heroin and cocaine. And as Peter says, "If God made anything better, he kept it for himself."

So this one also checks out.

### Case's angry fix: beta-phenethylamine
