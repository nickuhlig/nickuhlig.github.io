a scent that crowds out thought and sound<br>
as i walk into that nervous sanctum--<br>
the Logan airport lavatory--<br>
my suitcase wheels galloping across the tiles<br>
like the hooves of some absurdly tiny horse<br>

in volumes large enough, i guess<br>
this dubious perfume might be as cheap<br>
as secrets shouted in the sweat-hot din<br>
of rooms, or halls, or yards<br>
filled to the brim<br>
with talk, or tunes, or both<br>
but always beer and smoke and tang of teenage breath<br>
upon whose gusts rides that gentle venom<br>
that same smell, that naked sugar kiss<br>
of peach schnapps.<br>

her words are gone now.<br>
all that survives is a humid memory<br>
who leans her slender weight upon the windows of my mind.<br>
i splash my face with water<br>
before my journey home.
