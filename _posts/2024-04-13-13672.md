i spot it as i turn the corner,<br>
face now close-hauled to the wind<br>
which hisses through the brittle grass<br>
--that thirsty, golden ocean--<br>
chilling the sweat on my forehead.

unmissable it seems to hover<br>
in that cold and brilliant gasp of blue<br>
until it banks, the soars.<br>
its rigid wings not flapping once,<br>
it rides the swells of air that crash upon the slope.

it does not stray too far:<br>
its master, seated on the ridge<br>
(a folding nylon chair, begrudging nod to leisure)<br>
mutely draws it back each time,<br>
the creance never seen.

my breathing slows.

i watch this undead thing in its diomedean flight,<br>
and feel quite sure that it will go on gliding, hungerless,<br>
surveying all these tousled prairie waves<br>
until the end of days.
