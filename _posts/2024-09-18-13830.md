sometimes i forget.<br>
the furniture is all the same,<br>
and the arguments and the jokes,<br>
and the conversations too. all too easy.

but then a wrong thing trips<br>
the mind, that upward hypnic jerk<br>
--a label<br>
--a misused word<br>
--the gossamer contours of an unfamiliar moonlit bedroom.

and in its place, memory:<br>
like an oft-cradled bell jar<br>
a butterfly slowly decaying within<br>
fond scores of fingerprints crazing the glass.

the pain of returning,<br>
like an inquisitive tongue to a wound in the mouth,<br>
until i forget again.
