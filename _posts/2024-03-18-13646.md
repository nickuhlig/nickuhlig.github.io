most things i can recall of him <br>
are like brief flashes that one sees, <br>
reflected at the bottom of a well.

and if i were to take the time <br>
to draw upon that fickle source, <br>
the treasure i would find might be:

the coin of well remembered fact; <br>
or else the chilling, toothe-ache draught <br>
that slakes the thirst, yet cannot feed the heart.
