most things i can recall of him
are like brief flashes that one sees,
reflected at the bottom of a well.

and if i were to take the time
to draw upon that fickle source,
the treasure i would find might be:

the coin of well remembered fact;
or else the chilling, toothe-ache draught
that slakes the thirst, yet cannot feed the heart.
