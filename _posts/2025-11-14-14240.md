I wrote a small Excel tool, inspired by the now-defunct [ChemCell](https://depth-first.com/articles/2010/11/01/chemcell-easily-convert-names-and-cas-numbers-to-chemical-structures-in-excel/) which allows lookup of a couple chemical identifiers (SMILES, CAS) as well as allowing the user to pull pricing, vendor, lead time information from the MolPort API.

You need an API key for MolPort to allow the costing/sourcing functions to work, but if you don't need that you can still use the PubChem PUG REST lookup functions.
