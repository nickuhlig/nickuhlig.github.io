## About this site

This is a site maintained as a portal to my online presence, and also a rarely-updated set of writings about things related to chemistry, beer brewing, clothing, and music. As of 2024 I also write some novice poetry.

I frequently work on projects that have nothing to do with my field of study. Some of these projects can be lumped under music & arts, fashion, municipal politics, and design. Mostly I just consider them things that I do to entertain myself. You can find these here as well, usually under [projects](https://nickuhlig.github.io/projects/).

The typefaces used on this website are MEGAZERO by [Alex Trochut](https://alextrochut.com/), ITC Avant Garde Pro Bold, and Replica (in its Light and Regular weights). Code for this website was mostly adapted from [someone much smarter than me](https://rsms.me). This code is licensed under [CC BY 3.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/).

## About me

I'm a Canadian chemist currently living in the Boston, Massachusetts area. I work in biotech doing process chemistry.

I'm originally from Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario and I've lived in Guelph, Toronto, Montreal, Edmonton, and Prague. I speak English natively, French at an intermediate level, and Czech at an ever-decaying level (I was, at one time, fluent).

You can find me elsewhere on the internet using the links at the bottom of the page.
