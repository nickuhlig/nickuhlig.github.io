## Hello there.

<img src="me.jpg" class="profile-picture" width="128" align="right">

My name is Nick Uhlig. I'm a Canadian chemist currently living in Edmonton, Alberta. I currently work for Gilead Alberta ULC, a subsidiary of [Gilead Sciences](https://www.gilead.com), a California-based pharmaceutical company.

I'm originally from Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, and I lived in Montréal, Québec for several years while attending [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca) for my PhD studies.

You can find me elsewhere on the internet using the links at the bottom of the page. 

### This site

This is a site maintained as a portal to my online presence, and also a rarely-updated set of writings about things related to chemistry, beer brewing, clothing, and music.

I frequently work on projects that have nothing to do with my field of study. Some of these projects can be lumped under music & arts, fashion, and design. Mostly I just consider them dumb shit that I do to entertain myself. You can find these here as well.

The typefaces used on this website are ITC Avant Garde Pro Bold and Replica (in its Light and Regular weights). Icons used were created by [DaanKirk](https://thenounproject.com/daandirk/collection/platonic-solids/). Code for this website was mostly stolen/adapted from [someone much smarter than me](https://rsms.me). These are licensed under [CC BY 3.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/).
